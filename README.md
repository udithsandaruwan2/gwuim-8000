## 🚀 Creating an Executable (.exe) File

To easily run the application with one click, you can create an executable file (.exe) using **PyInstaller**. Follow the steps below:

### 📌 Prerequisites
- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 🏗️ Virtual environment (for Python projects)
- **PyInstaller** (to create the .exe)
- **App icon** (app_icon.png for the executable)

### 📦 Steps to Create the Executable

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leave-management-system.git
   cd leave-management-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Install Python dependencies by running:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3.. **Run the `executable_creator.py` script**:
   
   To generate the `.exe` file, run:
   ```sh
      pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=app_icon.ico app.py
   ```

   This will package the project into an executable (`app.exe`) located in the `dist` folder. The `.exe` file will have the `app_icon.png` as the icon.

4. **Test the executable**:
   - Once the `.exe` file is generated, go to the `dist` folder and double-click the `app.exe` file.
   - It should:
     1. Activate the virtual environment.
     2. Navigate to the project folder.
     3. Run the `python manage.py runserver` command to start the Django development server.

5. **Manual Server Start (Optional)**:
   - If you prefer to manually start the Django server without using the `.exe` file, you can run the following command:
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   - Visit the application at `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.
